# CoinToss

This notebook simulates a coin tossing game where the player gets to pick a string of head/tail occurances as the endgame. 
A coin is tossed until the chosen sequence of head/tail occurs. 
When the endgame sequence occurs the game ends. 
The objective is finding the sequence of head/tail occurances (for a given sequence length) that will be end the game with the least number of tosses. 
This is simulated by running a given number of coin toss games with the chosen endgame sequence. 
The avarage number of tosses required to win is computed and its distribution is plotted.
